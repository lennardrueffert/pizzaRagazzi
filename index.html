        This is an ported version of the original project since github pages only supports static content.
        <br>
        It is missing a lot of its original elements and functions like database integration, a server client structure, social features,
        a complex progression system and more.
        <br>
        The original project with all its elements and features was created during a University Group Project with 4 other Students (Andreas Balser, Daniel Schuhmann, Jacob Munke, Julian Dockendorf).
        <br>
        If you want to have a look at the sourcecode, contact me.

        Not optimized for tablets or smartphones, explore and play on a Computer with Chrome for the best experience!
        Also there's no darkmode from here ;)
