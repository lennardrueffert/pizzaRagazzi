        This is an ported version of the original project since github pages only supports static content.
        <br>
        It is missing a lot of its original elements and functions like database integration, server client structure
        and a complex progression system.
        The original project, which was created during a University Group Project with 4 other Students (credit placeholder),
        can be viewed on github <a href="https://github.com/Pixelhuber/Pizza_Ragazzi">here</a>.
